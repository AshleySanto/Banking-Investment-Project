# Banking-Investment-Project

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was to allow students to learn the concepts on adulthood regarding banking. Specifically, this program is to teach how investing and compound interest works by showing students how their investments will grow over time.

#What did you do particularly well?

I was able to produce the correct equations to calculate interest based on user input. I was also able to create a user friendly interface that is easy to read and understand. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think the code could be enhanced by making methods outside of the main function. This would lessen the amount of code within main and make it easier to understand for others looking at. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The hardest part for me was actual formatting and syntax. I'm completely new to C++ before this class and learning how to format a program so it's readable and understanding the different syntax C++ has was a bit of a challenge. I did have help from tutors, family members and online help such as Stack Overflow to figure out any issues I was having.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills that would be transferrable from this particular project is using calculation with C++ as well as practice with iterating loops. Loops have been a bit of a weakness for me and this gave me much more practice in using them. This also gave me practice in design and formatting a user interface as trying to get lines to perfectly line up took some time. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This program is maintainable, readable and adaptable because I made sure to put an adequate amount of comments into my code to make it easily understandbale to what is going on. I also used spacing to my advantage making it easier to read and understand the code. There is definitely way this program could be adapted and grown to include more banking practice for students and it would be simple to include those menthods.
